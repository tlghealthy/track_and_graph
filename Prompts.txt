Prompt 1:
Make a daily tracking app using python and tkinter with these core features: 1. easy add and reorder daily items on the main tracking tab. each has a checkbox indicating completed or not. 2. show the current date at the top of the tracking tab 3. A 'copy previous' button copies values from the previously logged day to current 4. to the right of the tracking tab is the graphs tab which has an item selection pane on the left and the graph view pane on the right. 5. Code it in a style that is easy to debug so that each significant line has a print statement.

Prompt 2:
There are a couple small and larger improvements I would like: 1. automatically select the input box so I can type after pressing the add button and also enter should submit like pressing the save button. 2. When adding a new item there should be a type dropdown menu with complete/incomplete as the default, and double, float, int, string as options too. 3. On the graphing tab these values should be shown over time as a bar graph by default (string doesn't need graphing for now)

Prompt 3:
Good progress! A few more improvements would be: 1. There might be a bug with editing the current day's data which seems to overwrite the data from the previous day it was copied from too. 2. Allow tabbing and enter to use buttons and dropdowns with arrows.

Prompt 4:
Next add graphing for completed/boolean tasks as 0 or 1 value. Let's add a settings tab with ui scale, ui padding, and any other easy settings to let users make the ui easier to see. Also, when opening the app for the first time each day let's always copy over the previous day's items, but optionally allow the 'copy over' button to prefill them in with data. And there should be previous and next day buttons to navigate and edit other days' data.

Prompt 5:
Bug introduced: can't add new items
Exception in Tkinter callback
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "C:\Users\Max\Documents\GitHub\AutomationTools\TrackGraph\track_graph.py", line 153, in add_item
AttributeError: 'DailyTrackingApp' object has no attribute 'dropdown_key_navigation'
Don't need both float and double types so let's only use float.

Prompt 6:
Great, this is going well so far! Now the next feature might be a bigger change so let's see if we can do it without breaking what we have working already. I would like the items on the tracking tab and the graphs tab to have a folders feature added so that I can organize them and collapse and expand the folders. I would also like to be able to drag items into other folders or just drag them to reorder as well.

Prompt 7:
Ok from testing I already found an issue so let's work through it: opening the app and adding a new item does seem to add the item but the 'add item window' does not close and shows this error:
"C:\Users\Max\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\tkinter\ttk.py", line 1434, in set
    res = self.tk.call(self._w, "set", item, column, value)
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
_tkinter.TclError: Invalid column index path

Prompt 8:
Nice that fixed that problem! now I noticed a couple other things: 1. reordering by dragging items does work, but the order is not saved for next time I close and open the app. 2. I cannot drag items into folders because it just reorders them right now so either we need to detect the type (item or folder) when an item is dropped after dragging and if it is a folder we move the item to be part of that folder or we could have a new button which indents the currently selected item if there is a folder directly above it in the list and then it becomes part of that folder.
